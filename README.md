# flask_login
## Microsoft login

Before making this branch i watched a youtube-video from Vinsent Stevenson on the subject. Youtube:(https://youtu.be/oW1SJxGiaZA) . If you wish to introduce Microsoft authentication to your flask application i recomend checking out that video.

Huge parts of the code from this branch has been generated by choosing quickstart after step 2 in the list bellow. Quickstart for python will generate a Flask application for you

First you have to login at https://portal.azure.com/

1. Go to Home > App registrations > New registration.
2. Register your app. For this project i only named my app, set the supported account type to multitenant, and added two redirect URIs(http://localhost:5000/getAToken and http://127.0.0.1:5000/getAToken) before pressing create.
3. After doing that you should be directed to Home > App registrations > "YOUR_APP_NAME". 
4. Go to Certificates & secrets > New client secret and create a new client secret. Save this somewhere safe ass it will only be displayed once by the azure portal
5. All the changes needed for this project to run is in the app_config.py file. Given that you have registerd a multitenant application and are running it on localhost, all you have to do to make this branch run is to fill inn your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.
